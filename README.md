#  Docker System Checker Script



This script provides various functionalities to check the status and configuration of your Docker environment.



##  Usage



1.  **Download the Script**:

`curl -sSL https://github.com/voidagency/sys-check/raw/main/sys-check.sh -o docker_system_checker.sh`



3.  **Make the Script Executable**:

`chmod +x docker_system_checker.sh`



4.  **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running the following command:

`./docker_system_checker.sh [project_name] [domain_name]`



Replace `[project_name]` with the project name used for container names (for [easypanel](https://easypanel.io/) it should simply be the project name). If not provided, Docker container communication checks will be aborted.



Replace `[domain_name]` with the domain name for which you want to check SSL certificates and curl subdomains. This argument is optional. If not provided, SSL certificate and subdomain checks will be skipped.
